# Peek.js - Change Log:

## Version 1.1.0:
- Added new binding option called "showOnly" (excepts a string, or string array), which states the properties that should be shown in the dialog.
- Added new binding option called "allowEditing" (defaults to false), which allows CSS and Attribute values to be entered (simply type and press Enter).
- Fixed a fault that caused the dialog elements to be included when viewing specific node types.
- Added a new data attribute called "data-peek-js-ignore-state", which can be set to "ignore" on element so that they cannot be used by the viewer.

## Version 1.0.0:
