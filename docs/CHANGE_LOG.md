# Peek.js - Change Log:

## Version 1.1.0:
- Added new binding option called "showOnly" (excepts a string, or string array), which states the properties that should be shown in the dialog.
- Added new binding option called "allowEditing" (defaults to false), which allows CSS and Attribute values to be entered (simply type and press Enter).

## Version 1.0.0:
- Everything :)
